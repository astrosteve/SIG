PATCH NOTES:

9/30/20 - Version 5.5

* More work on the raiding system. It should successfully run through sngeons and then send a message to the console saying it was successful. I have not tried
it out yet.

* This is the last version for a long time, probably. I'm working now and have a lot less free time. Also, there's another project I've been planning and thinking
about for years and I think I'd like to use my now-limited programming time on that project. I may come back to SIG at some point, but it'll probably be a while.

* Added TODO document showing some future plans in case anyone is curious where this was heading.

9/20/20 - Version 5

* Started combat engine for dungeon raiding. Still a long way from being functional, but it's getting there. Since this version isn't technically fully running,
  committing it to a new branch.

* Changed the order of the main loop around to put things in an order that makes more sense. They were originally in the order I created the functions.

* Added message to indicate game autosaved.

* Fixed various spots with screwed up formatting.

* Soldiers now become Privates on being hired. There's five ranks total, none of which have any meaning yet. (Private, Major, Captain, Colonel, General) 
  Eventually they'll be used for something. Something involving war with (as of now) unimplemented foreign nations.

* Disabled autosave as I realized there's a problem: If you load the page and let it sit there for 90 cycles, it'll save a new game over any previous game.
  Until I figure out how to fix this, I'd rather autosave just not be a thing.
  
* Removed variables I declared but never used anywhere in the code. Unsure what they were intended for.


9/18/20 - Version 4

* Added save/load system and periodic autosave. (Currently every 90 cycles)

9/13/20 - Version 3

* Added starvation and death for monks and lamas. Soldiers and Missionaries are currently immortal.  You would not believe how long it took me to get this to work right.

* Redid the HTML file a bit and moved some stuff around.

* Probably other stuff, but it's midnight and I'm tired.

9/10/20 - Version 3: 
* Added Bread, Bakeries and Soldiers. Monks, Lamas, Soldiers now all need food. Food cannot go negative and there is not yet any penalty for not having
food.

* Added acreage variables but have not implemented it as I'm not sure how I want it to work.

* Fixed Lama cost issue.

* Fleshed out error generation to show specific problem.

9/9/2020 - Version 1. This is actually the third revision I've commited to github, but the first where I've written notes, so this is officially
Version 1 of SIG. It's considered to be in the Building/Prototype stage now, not even considered a game yet, really.


KNOWN ISSUES:

* Numbers get a little funky when people start dying and don't update. I think most stuff should be updating correctly now. As of Version 4, everything
  seems okay. (Tentatively fixed)
 
* Error does not display when you try to recruit a soldier but do not have enough power. (FIXED)

FEATURES PLANNED:

Features will be added roughly based on their priorities.

* Do something, anything, with soldiers and missionaries! (high priority) - In Progress
* Add non-power generating buy options that affect the power options. (eg, a bakery to supply your Monks and Lamas with food. Mid-priority.) - In Progress
* Options to use your acquired power for more than just buying monks, lamas and bakeries. (eg, stuff totally unrelated to power acquisition.) - In Progress
  short term mid priority, long term high priority.)
* Story mode, which enables you to learn about yourself and your abilities. (short term low priority, long term high priority)
* Option to pick a number of items to buy. 10 Monks instead of 1, 150 housing instead of 10, etc. (Low priority)
* Add land owned, add ability to acquire additional land. (Low priority)
* Add Save/Load function. (mid priority) - Completed
