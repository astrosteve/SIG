PATCH NOTES:

9/10/20 - Version 2: 
* Added Bread, Bakeries and Soldiers. Monks, Lamas, Soldiers now all need food. Food cannot go negative and there is not yet any penalty for not having
food.

* Added acreage variables but have not implemented it as I'm not sure how I want it to work.

* Fixed Lama cost issue.

* Fleshed out error generation to show specific problem.

9/9/2020 - Version 1. This is actually the third revision I've commited to github, but the first where I've written notes, so this is officially
Version 1 of SIG. It's considered to be in the Building/Prototype stage now, not even considered a game yet, really.


KNOWN ISSUES:

* Error does not display when you try to recruit a soldier but do not have enough power.

FEATURES PLANNED:

Features will be added roughly based on their priorities.

* Add non-power generating buy options that affect the power options. (eg, a bakery to supply your Monks and Lamas with food. Mid-priority.)
* Options to use your acquired power for more than just buying monks, lamas and bakeries. (eg, stuff totally unrelated to power acquisition.
  short term mid priority, long term high priority.)
* Story mode, which enables you to learn about yourself and your abilities. (short term low priority, long term high priority)
* Option to pick a number of items to buy. 10 Monks instead of 1, 150 housing instead of 10, etc. (Low priority)
* Add land owned, add ability to acquire additional land. (Low priority)
