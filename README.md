# SIG

SIG (Steve's Incremental Game) is a silly thing I'm doing to learn javascript. There's not much going on with it right now. You have a max of 10 monks/lamas and there's currently 
no way to raise that limit. It doesn't do anything else, really. 

Upcoming:

* Add a way to increase housing and display housing limit on screen.
* Add more stuff to buy.
* Add geographic information. (It'll eventually have a procedurally generated game world you can interact with, if I get that far.)
