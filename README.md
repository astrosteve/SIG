# SIG

SIG (Steve's Incremental Game) is a silly thing I'm doing to learn javascript. It's a god simulator where you're a god trying to get power. The rest of the story will be revealed in the game itself. Unsure how much I'll develop this as I'm doing it on a whim during a period of unemployment. Once my job starts up (9/28/20) you may not see this updated anymore, or possibly updated very infrequently. (Like once every few months)

See Patch Notes text for development info.
