# SIG

SIG (Steve's Incremental Game) is a silly thing I'm doing to learn javascript. It's a god simulator wher eyou're a god trying to get power. The rest of the story will be revealed in the game itself. Unsure how much I'll develop this as I'm doing it on a whim during a period of unemployment. Once my job starts up (in 2 1/2 weeks) you may not see this updated anymore.

See Patch Notes text for development info.
