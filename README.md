# SIG

SIG (Steve's Incremental Game) is a silly thing I'm doing to learn javascript. There's not much going on with it right now. You have a max of 10 monks/lamas and there's currently 
no way to raise that limit. It doesn't do anything else, really. 

Upcoming:

* Add a way to increase housing and display housing limit on screen. - done
* Add more stuff to buy.
* Add geographic information. (It'll eventually have a procedurally generated game world you can interact with, if I get that far.)

----

Known Bugs:

* When buying Praying Lamas, the first is for 100 prayers. The price won't increment for the second purchase but the purchase will always fail, no matter what. The price increments and it starts working normally after that. I have no idea what's wrong.
